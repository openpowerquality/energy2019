% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%

  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with

  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx

% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}

<sentence about pressures to modernize grids and citation>
Introducing renewable energy generation to existing electrical grid infrastructures has proven itself to be an engineering challenge. The transition to cleaner energy generation methods such as wind and solar, which are inherently stochastic, has increased the severity and frequency of power quality phenomena \cite{Radu:2014:RenewableImpacts}. Sensitive instruments connected to an unstable grid can potentially be thrown off of calibration or damaged.

The first step to correcting power quality phenomena is understanding the problem from top to bottom. Electricity being supplied by the grid should be continuously monitored to detect and log power quality events. Records that classify power quality phenomena can reveal problematic patterns of the system and provide potential explanations for failures that can be understood and resolved. 

There are many great scientist in the community who would agree that there is a need to be able to classify power quality phenomena and they have come up with impressive methodologies \cite{Garrido:2014:PhenomenaClassification} \cite{Manikandan:2014:PQClassificationUsingSSD} \cite{Thirumala:2016:PQClassificationUsingWavelet} \cite{Rodriguez:2014:PQClassificationUsingANN} \cite{Tse:2012:PQClassificationUsingHHT}. Current state of the art techniques commonly utilize wavelet transforms for feature extraction and then run the data through a trained neural network or decision tree algorithm.  Another more novel approach by Manikandan, Samantaray, and Kamwa \cite{Manikandan:2014:PQClassificationUsingSSD} decomposes the signal using sparse signal decomposition on an overcomplete hybrid dictionary matrix and then extracts the power disturbance features of the decomposed signal and classifies the transient waveforms using a decision tree algorithm. These approaches are...

The contribution of this paper is a tractable, robust, and verified method for classifying transients by leveraging the well defined characteristics of the transients we are interested in. ...

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:Methodology}
The transients that are classified with the methodologies proposed in this paper are clearly defined in the IEEE 1159 Draft Recommended Practice for Monitoring Electric Power Quality \cite{IEEE:2018:1159D3}. Table \ref{TransientClasses} summarizes the definition and characteristics of each transient.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Transient Classes}\label{TransientClasses}

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
\textit{Class} & \textit{Description} \\
\hline
Impulsive & Unidirectional change from the nominal waveform. \\

Periodic Notching & Periodic and strictly negative in power. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\captionsetup{font={footnotesize,rm},justification=centering,labelsep=period}%

A decision tree algorithm is used to classify signals with potential transients. The benefit of this approach is that it minimizes unnecessary computation. As power quality features are mined from the signal, the potential classes that it could fall into are narrowed. Computationally expensive analysis can be bypassed if simple features can rule out a class early in the process. Leveraging this idea, the potential transients are checked to see if they fit the classes in the same order as listed in table \ref{TransientClasses}. Once the signal is classified, then additional meta data can be computed that appropriately detail the transient.

\subsection{Signal Decomposition}

The first task is to decompose the raw signal into the fundamental waveform and the potential transient waveform. In the context of this application, the fundamental waveform is expected to have little to no variation from the standard, which for where this methodology was tested is $60$Hz and $120$ Vrms \cite{ANSI:2016:C84.1-2016}. There is the potential for simultaneous waveform distortion and transient power quality phenomena. However, waveform distortions for frequency phenomena are typically found to only vary by $\pm 0.1$Hz and for voltage phenomena by $0.1-1.8$pu \cite{IEEE:2018:1159D3}. Whereas the transients that the system is capturing typically have a spectral content between $1$kHz-$5$MHz. 

Thus, a simple digital implementation of a low pass $4^{th}$ order Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency at $500$Hz is justifiable and practical for this application to extract the fundamental waveform from the raw digital signal. A different filter could have been used to achieve similar results. Using a Butterworth filter with the order and cutoff frequency mentioned was a design decision made for its tractability and due to the desirable property that the filter is monotonic in both the passband and stopband resulting is a clean decomposition. Once the fundamental waveform is retrieved, the transient waveform is then obtained by subtracting out the fundamental waveform from the raw signal.

\subsection{Classifying Impulsive Transients}

First in the decision tree algorithm is the test for the whether the transient could be impulsive. This is the first class to test since the power quality traits that are necessary and sufficient to show that the transient is impulsive are computationally cheap to verify. As defined by the IEEE 1159 standards, an impulsive transient is a unidirectional change from the nominal condition of the voltage \cite{IEEE:2018:1159D3}. Therefore, a simple check which ensures that the excitation in the transient waveform is unipolar will qualify the transient to be in the broad category of impulsive transients. 

If the transient is impulsive, then arcing and oscillatory can be ruled out. Additional corner cases do need to be accounted for since there is a chance that the transient could also be periodic notching. If the impulsive transient was positive in power, then periodic notching can be ruled out, otherwise it needs to be tested. At this point meta data detailing the rise and decay time, the peak amplitude, and whether or not the transient caused additional zero crossings in the raw signal can be calculated and recorded with the classification. 

\subsection{Classifying Arcing Transients}

The test for arcing... 

\subsection{Classifying Oscillatory Transients}

An oscillatory transient is a bipolar change that typically lasts between a few milliseconds to a quarter cycle of the nominal waveform. It is characterized by its frequency content and decay rate \cite{IEEE:2018:1159D3}. 

To determine whether the potential transient fits the oscillatory classification, the system implements an incremental F-Test. The null hypothesis of the test is  $H_0: \beta_3 = \beta_4 = \beta_5 = 0$ in the complete model shown in equation \ref{eq:completeModel}. The F-Test gives a numerical value of the significance of additional variables added to the regression function. 

First a least squares curve fitting of the potential transient waveform and an exponentially decaying sinusoid is determined using gradient descent. The complete model is shown in equation \ref{eq:completeModel}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:completeModel}
\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 e^{-\beta_2 t} cos(\beta_3 \cdot 2 \pi t + \beta_4)
\end{equation}

Then a reduced model is fit using the same least square fitting methods. The reduced model equation is shown in \ref{eq:reducedModel}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:reducedModel}
\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 e^{-\beta_2 t}
\end{equation}

Large values of F result in rejection of the null hypothesis and the classification of the transient to oscillatory. The threshold value that F must pass is a design decision and will determine the expected type 1 and type 2 errors of the classification. 

Additional meta data that can be recorded after the classification includes the decay rate, frequency content, dc offset, and peak amplitude, all of which follow immediately from the curve fitting. 

\subsection{Classifying Periodic Notching Transients}

A periodic notching transient is a periodic and strictly negative power disruption of the nominal waveform. Therefore, the signal is first verified to be strictly negative in power before further analysis is made. If so, the system moves on to determine whether the potential transient waveform is periodic. 

To test for periodicity the autocorrelation of the signal is computed. Autocorrelation highlights the similarity between the signal and its previous values. The method used by the system convolves the first half the transient signal with the original transient. The convolution is only calculated for points where the signals completely overlap. If the potential transient is indeed periodic, then the resulting signal from the convolution will have the same periodicity with peaks that highlight where the signal had the highest correlation. 

The peaks of the autocorrelation signal are determined by setting a height threshold. Then the standard deviation of distance between the peaks is found, and if its is less than a defined threshold the signal is determined to be periodic. At which point the period can be easily calculated from autocorrelation signal along with additional interesting meta data to characterize the transient.

\section{Implementation}
The methodologies proposed in this paper were implemented and tested on the Open Power Quality (OPQ) system. The OPQ project began in 2012 with the goal of developing and evaluating technology to support important improvements to the electrical infrastructure. 

At the 10,000 foot level, the OPQ system architecture is simple: OPQ boxes are plugged into outlets, they monitor the quality of power, and the results are communicated to cloud based storage. Taking a closer look, OPQ consists of four major open source hardware and software components that provide end-to-end support for the capture, triggering, analysis, and reporting of local and global level power quality phenomena. 

The Makai system is responsible for aggregating and processing the measurements generated by the OPQ boxes. The triggering broker will create a power quality event when it detects a deviation from the nominal waveform in a low fidelity data stream and send a message to the Mauka system to analyze the event further. The Mauka system is where the high fidelity analysis is completed, and where the transient detection system is implemented.

First, the raw signal decomposed into its fundamental and potential transient waveform. The fundamental waveform is extracted using a digital implementation of a 4th order low pass Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of $500$Hz. The digital filter used is an implementation in the scientific Python library SciPy \cite{scipy:2019}. The transient waveform is then the raw waveform minus the fundamental waveform.

It cannot safely be assumed that only a single transient exists in a power quality event triggered by the Mauka system. Therefore, before classification, the complete transient waveform is separated into potential windows with individual transients. This is achieved through a sliding window technique with a predefined threshold for a maximum lull. The maximum lull between transients is a design decision that is made with domain knowledge. The transients that are being classified with the system are expected to have a duration on the order of miliseconds. 

The sliding window method works by first scanning the transient waveform and finding the first measurement which is above the configuration noise floor. It is common practice to account for potential instrumentation error by defining a noise floor. Measurement deviating from the nominal waveform more than the defined noise floor are considered to be significant and can reasonably considered to be a power quality phenomena and not a faulty measurement. The noise floor in the implementation is defined to be $5\%$ of the nominal voltage. 

The first measurement above the noise floor is considered to be the starting point of the transient. Then the scanning continues until there is a lull in measurements above the noise floor longer than the defined maximum, or the scanning has reached the end of the transient signal. At which point the last significant measurement is defined to be the endpoint of the potential transient. This process is repeated until the end of the transient signal is reached.

Once the start and endpoints of all of the potential transients is determined, then the classification analysis can begin. Feature extraction and the decision tree structure is described in detail in section \ref{sec:Methodology}. Only important implementation notes will be mentioned in the rest of this section.

The multiple non linear least squares regression required for classification of the oscillatory transient is an implementation in the SciPy library \cite{scipy:2019}. The solution to the regression is an approximation obtained by a gradient descent method. Since the expected characteristics of oscillatory transients are known, the gradient descent method can be seeded to increase the rate at which a local optima is found.

To classify periodic notching transient classification a convolution operation is necessary. The code used to implement this calculation is found in the NumPy library \cite{numpy}.
